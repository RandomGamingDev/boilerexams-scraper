    "solution": "No it is not possible. In a simple undirected graph with 5 vertices each of degree 3, the total number of degrees will be 15 (5*3). In an undirected graph, there are no in-degrees and out-degrees, instead there are simply undirected edges such that for every edge added, 2 degrees total will be added to the graph (1 on each participating vertex which are not the same because it is a simple graph). If we imagine a graph of 5 vertexes completely unconnected (no edges between them), we see it has 0 degrees and every edge added will increase the total number of degrees by 2. Thus we can only have even numbers of total degrees and will never achieve 15.",
