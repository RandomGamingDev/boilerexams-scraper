    "body": "TLDR: This problem asks about the qualitative behavior of x(t) after \"a long time has passed\". From this information we can deduce that the problem is asking how the general solution to the model of this question behaves as ${t\\to\\infty}$. When $t = 0$, $x(t)=x_c(t)+x_p(t)$. However, when ${t\\to\\infty}$, $x(t)=x_p(t)$ where $x_p(t)=Acos(\\omega t) + Bsin(\\omega t)$. If you were to graph this it would look like a sine wave. And since $x(t)=x_p(t)$ when ${t\\to\\infty}$, $x(t)$ will behave like answer C which is also a sine wave.\n\nIn-Depth Explanation:\nThis problem deals with a damped mass-spring system. As such we can model a differential equation that takes up the form of $mx''+cx'+kx=F_0cos(\\omega t)$. This differential equation is an inhomogeneous second order linear differential equation. So the general solution of this differential equation will take up the form of $x(t)=x_c(t)+x_p(t)$ where $x_c(t)$ is the homogeneous complementary portion of the solution and $x_p(t)$ is the inhomogeneous particular portion of the solution. \n\nGenerally speaking, we know that $x_c(t)$ takes up the form of $C_1 e^{\\lambda_1 t}+C_2 e^{\\lambda_2 t} +...$. Additionally, the inhomogenous portion of the differential equation is $F_0cos(\\omega t)$. As such $x_p(t)$ can be found using the method of undetermined coefficients giving us a solution that takes up the form of $Acos(\\omega t) + Bsin(\\omega t)$. So $x(t)$ would be equal to something taking up the form of $C_1 e^{\\lambda_1 t}+C_2 e^{\\lambda_2 t} +... + Acos(\\omega t) + Bsin(\\omega t)$. \n\nThe key takeaway from this is that in order to solve for $C_1$ and $C_2$ we would need to take into account the initial conditions of the problem (assuming this is an IVP). However in order to solve for $A$ and $B$, those terms are not dependent on initial conditions. And we know that $x_p(t)$ takes up the form of $Acos(\\omega t) + Bsin(\\omega t)$ As such that makes $x_p(t)$ a Steady Periodic Solution.\n\nSince we know that $C_1$ and $C_2$ are dependent on initial conditions we can deduce that the behavior of the solution when $t=0$ is $x(t)=x_c(t)+x_p(t)$. But initial conditions matter less and less as time progresses (keyword being initial). That means that the behavior of $x_c(t)$ becomes more and more insignificant over time. From this we can model a limit of the general solution $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}x(t)=x_p(t)$. \n\nWe know that $x_p(t)=Acos(\\omega t) + Bsin(\\omega t)$. If you were to graph this it would take up the form of a sinusoidal wave and the closest matching answer to $x_p(t)=Acos(\\omega t) + Bsin(\\omega t)$ is answer choice C.",
