    "body": " A group of dietitians conducted a study to investigate the impact of consuming pasta with and without a source of protein on the post-meal rise in blood sugar levels. They collected an SRS of 50 participants and randomly assigned each to either group 1 or group 2, until one group reached the size of 25. The remaining participants were assigned to the other group.  During the experiment, all the participants were on an identical, strictly controlled diet for one week. At the end of the week, Group 1 was given a meal consisting of pasta with an additional source of protein, and group 2 was given the same pasta dish without any additional source of protein. Blood sugar levels were measured for each participant both before and after the meal, and the differences (\u201cafter\u201d minus \u201cbefore\u201d measured in milligrams per deciliter, mg/dL) were recorded. The summary statistics are shown in the table below. \n\n(B) The researchers would like to know whether eating pasta with a source of protein reduces the rise in blood sugar level compared to eating pasta alone. They have set a significance level of \ud835\udf36=\ud835\udfce.\ud835\udfce\ud835\udfd3.  State the null and the alternative hypothesis compatible with their question. Whether you have chosen two-sample independent or two sample-paired use the same order of subtraction as in the table (Group1-Group2). Clearly define the parameter(s) used in the hypothesis. \n\n(D)  At 95% confidence, what is the choice that is compatible with the hypotheses given in part (b): confidence interval, lower confidence bound, or upper confidence bound? Explain your choice. ",
