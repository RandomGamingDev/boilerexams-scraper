    "body": "A college dietitian has developed three diet plans, namely Diet 1, Diet 2, and Diet 3, to assist college students in losing weight. The weight of participants who followed these diet programs was measured in pounds both before starting the diet and after completing three months on the respective diet plan. The dietitian is investigating whether there are any differences in the effectiveness of these three diets in terms of the average weight loss achieved. Weight loss is defined as the difference between the weight measured after three months and the weight measured before starting the diet. The summary information for each diet is provided below.\n\n(f) Given the results in part (e), will it be meaningful to conduct a pairwise comparison? Provide an explanation for your answer. \n\nRecall that part (e) states \"At 5% level of significance, is there evidence that the average weight lost due to at-least one Diet is different? Provide a formal decision and conclusion in context\"",
    "solution": "Yes, it will be meaningful. This is because we have identified that at least one diet results in an average weight loss that is different from the rest. The next step is to examine which diets are different.",
