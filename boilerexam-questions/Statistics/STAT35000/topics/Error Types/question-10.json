    "body": "A dietary supplement company plans to launch a product aimed at improving cholesterol levels. The supplement contains natural ingredients known for their cholesterol-lowering effects. Concerns arise about potential muscle cramps and spasms as adverse effects. To investigate, researchers conducted a six-month experiment with randomly assigned volunteers to the <b>placebo</b> or <b>supplement</b> group. Discomfort and pain levels are assessed through questions at the study's start (before taking supplement or placebo) and at the end (after six-months of using the supplement or placebo). A simple first step hypothesis is designed to test if the average difference in discomfort or pain scores ($\\mathbf{D=PAIN_{END} - PAIN_{START}}$) for the supplement group is greater than 0.\n\nWhat is a <b>Type I error</b> in the scenario of the simple hypothesis and what are the negative consequences for the dietary supplement company if the hypothesis test results in a <b>Type I error</b>?",
