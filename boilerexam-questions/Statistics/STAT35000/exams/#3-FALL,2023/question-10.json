    "body": "A college dietitian has developed three diet plans, namely Diet 1, Diet 2, and Diet 3, to assist college students in losing weight. The weight of participants who followed these diet programs was measured in pounds both before starting the diet and after completing three months on the respective diet plan. The dietitian is investigating whether there are any differences in the effectiveness of these three diets in terms of the average weight loss achieved. Weight loss is defined as the difference between the weight measured after three months and the weight measured before starting the diet. The summary information for each diet is provided below.\n\n(a) (2 points) Check the assumption of constant variance using the provided summary information. Show your work and state clearly whether the assumption was satisfied or\nnot. Apart from constant variance, you may assume that all other assumptions have been satisfied for the rest of the analysis. ",
    "solution": "smax/ smin = 1.21/ 0.8 = 1.5125 < 2\nSince, the ratio of the largest variance to the minimum variance is smaller than 2 the assumption\nis valid and we may proceed with the analysis.",
