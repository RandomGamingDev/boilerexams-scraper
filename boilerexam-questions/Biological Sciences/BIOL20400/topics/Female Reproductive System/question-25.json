    "body": "\\underline{\\textbf{Dyspnea}}\nDyspnea in pregnancy occurs because the enlarged uterus takes up more space in the abdominopelvic cavity, which pushes up against the diaphragm and prevents it from fully contracting, which prevents the lungs from fully expanding. \n\nAn increase in oxygen demand from the growing fetus also contributes. \n\n\\underline{\\textbf{Increase in Blood Volume}}\nThe blood volume also increases, to support the growing fetus. \n\n\\underline{\\textbf{Edema of the Ankles and Feet}}\nThe increased blood volume, as well as increased water retention, leads to an overall increase in fluid volume. This extra fluid tends to gather in the lower body. \n\n\\underline{\\textbf{Decrease of Cardiac Output}}\nIn pregnancy, we'd actually expect to see an increase in cardiac output. Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped out by the heart in a minute. Because the circulating blood volume has increased to support the fetus, more volume per minute is being pumped out by the heart. \n\nA decreased cardiac output would imply either lower blood volume or lower heart rate.
