    "body": "\\textbf{\\underline{Leptin}}\nLeptin is produced by fat cells, which are the main way the body stores energy. As fat stores increase, so does leptin production. \n\nLeptin acts on the hypothalamus to signal satiety and decrease appetite. This is a long-term process. Essentially, increased leptin signals the brain to eat less, and the lack of leptin signals the brain to eat more. \n\n\\textbf{\\underline{Ghrelin}}\nGhrelin, also called the \"hunger hormone\" is produced by the stomach and stimulates hunger/appetite. Its levels rise before eating, and decrease after. It works in the short term. \n\n\\textbf{\\underline{Amylin}}\nAmylin is secreted by the pancreas and functions to terminate eating and promote \"fullness\" (satiety). It works in the short term.\n\n\\textbf{\\underline{Peptide YY}}\nPeptide YY is a hormone secreted by enteroendocrine cells in the ileum and colon. Like amylin, it also signals satiety and to terminate eating. It also works in the short term.\n\n\n\n",
