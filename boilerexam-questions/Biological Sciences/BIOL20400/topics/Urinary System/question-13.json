    "body": "The parasympathetic (rest and digest) nervous system enables the bladder to empty by activation of M3 receptors.\n\nThe parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) is responsible for the emptying of the bladder. The PSNS is also known as the rest and digest system, and it's generally responsible for relaxing the body after times of stress and regulating digestion and urination. In contrast, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is active in times of stress and danger. It is commonly known as the fight or flight system. The two systems typically have opposite functions of each other. In times of stress and danger, the body wants to conserve energy and be ready for anything. That's why urination is mediated by the PSNS and not the SNS. \n\nMuscarinic receptors are typically associated with the PSNS, while beta-adrenergic receptors are typically associated with the SNS.
