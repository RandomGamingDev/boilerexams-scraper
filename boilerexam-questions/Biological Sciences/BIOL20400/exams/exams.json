It's an intrinsic mechanism, which means its maintained by the kidney and its effects are local. Here's how it works: \n\n$\\textbf{1.) Blood Pressure Changes}$  \nWhen blood pressure (BP) increases, it exerts a greater force on the walls of the afferent arteriole. \n\n$\\textbf{2.) Smooth Muscle Response}$  \nSmooth muscle cells have a tendency to contract when stretched. In response to the stretch caused by the increased BP, the smooth muscle in the walls of the arteriole contract, constricting the diameter of the afferent arteriole.\n\n$\\textbf{3.) Decrease in GFR}$\nThe constricted afferent arteriole decreases the amount of blood reaching the glomerulus. The pressure inside the glomerulus is decreased, and the GFR as well. \n\n\n\nSo, overall, when BP increases, GFR increases. The myogenic mechanism compensates for this and prevents damage to the glomerulus from a GFR that is too high. ",

In the cell, it again reacts with water and carbonic anhydrase to form H$_{2}$CO$_{3}$, which dissociates to form HCO$_{3}$- + H$^{+}$. The H$^{+}$ is sent back into the tubular fluid by the Na$^{+}$/H$^{+}$ antiporter, while the HCO$_{3}$- goes to the blood plasma. \n\nBy controlling the reabsorption of bicarbonate ions, the kidneys can adjust the blood bicarbonate concentration to compensate for any acid-base disturbances, particularly the metabolic component. \n\n$\\textbf{The Lungs}$\n\nWhile the lungs do play a major role in acid-base balance, they do so by controlling the concentration of CO$_{2}$.

          "body": "\\underline{\\textbf{Dyspnea}}\nDyspnea in pregnancy occurs because the enlarged uterus takes up more space in the abdominopelvic cavity, which pushes up against the diaphragm and prevents it from fully contracting, which prevents the lungs from fully expanding. \n\nAn increase in oxygen demand from the growing fetus also contributes. \n\n\\underline{\\textbf{Increase in Blood Volume}}\nThe blood volume also increases, to support the growing fetus. \n\n\\underline{\\textbf{Edema of the Ankles and Feet}}\nThe increased blood volume, as well as increased water retention, leads to an overall increase in fluid volume. This extra fluid tends to gather in the lower body. \n\n\\underline{\\textbf{Decrease of Cardiac Output}}\nIn pregnancy, we'd actually expect to see an increase in cardiac output. Cardiac output is the amount of blood pumped out by the heart in a minute. Because the circulating blood volume has increased to support the fetus, more volume per minute is being pumped out by the heart. \n\nA decreased cardiac output would imply either lower blood volume or lower heart rate.

This creates a positive feedback loop, leading to stronger and more frequent contractions, ultimately expelling the baby.\n\nWhile estrogen helps prepare the uterus for childbirth, oxytocin doesn't directly affect the number of estrogen receptors. \n\nProstaglandins help soften and thin the cervix during labor to allow the baby to pass through.

The male ejaculate contains hundreds of millions of sperm cells, but most will not make it near the egg. \n\nThe vagina has many defense mechanisms the sperm must make it through first. Millions of sperm leak from the vagina, some are destroyed by vaginal acid later, or by resident phagocytes in the uterus. \n\n\\underline{\\textbf{B.) Most will be destroyed by the alkaline environment of the vagina at ejaculation.}}\nThis option is incorrect because the vagina has an acidic environment, not an alkaline environment. Even then, buffers in the semen can buy some more time for sperm and the acidity of the vagina does not destroy them immediately. \n\n\\underline{\\textbf{C.) Most will be destroyed by capacitation before reaching the oocyte.}}\nCapacitation is the process sperm cells go through that allows them to penetrate and fertilize the egg. It doesn't result in their destruction. \n\n\\underline{\\textbf{D.) Only one will release its acrosomal enzymes to penetrate the outer layers of the oocyte.}}\nAny sperm cell that makes it to the oocyte and undergoes capacitation can release acrosomal enzymes.
