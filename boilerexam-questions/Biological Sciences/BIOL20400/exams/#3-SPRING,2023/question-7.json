The glomerulus is located here, where filtration occurs. \n\n$\\textbf{Structure 2}$ \nThe proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), where tubular reabsorption takes place to reclaim things such as glucose, amino acids, and sodium. Water tends to follow sodium by osmosis, so about 65% of filtered water is also reabsorbed here.  \n\n$\\textbf{Structure 3}$ \nThe nephron loop (loop of Henle), which is responsible for creating an osmotic gradient that helps conserve water and concentrate urine. This gradient is created by the countercurrent multiplier mechanism. \n\n$\\textbf{Structure 4}$ \nThe distal convoluted tubule, which plays a role the reabsorption of sodium ions. It is $\\underline{not}$ responsible for reabsorbing approximately 65% of filtered water and sodium and all the filtered amino acids and glucose. This happens in the PCT.\n\n$\\textbf{Structure 5}$ \nThe collecting duct, which is indeed relatively impermeable to water and solutes without the influence of hormones. The primary hormones that influence the CD are aldosterone and anti-diuretic hormone (ADH).\n\n\\pic{\"url\": \"https://i.imgur.com/DubnOhu.png\", \"alt\": \"alt goes here\", \"maxHeight\": \"200\"} ",
