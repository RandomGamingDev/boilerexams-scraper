    "body": "Increased plasma osmolality is when the plasma (ECF) has a higher concentration of solutes due to less fluid. \n\nIn this case, we would $\\textit{not}$ want to inhibit ADH secretion. ADH secretion will help us hold on to fluid, so we would not want to inhibit this. Similarly, we would not want to decrease water reabsorption. \n\nWater diuresis refers to the excretion of more water, which again, is not what we want. \n\nProduction of hypertonic urine on the other hand, is an appropriate response in this situation. Hypertonic urine is more concentrated (less water). This means that the body is holding on to as much water as possible, in an effort to lower the plasma osmolality as much as possible. ",
