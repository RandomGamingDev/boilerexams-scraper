    "body": "\\underline{\\textbf{A.) Only a few hundred of them will reach the vicinity of the egg.}}\nThis is the correct answer. The male ejaculate contains hundreds of millions of sperm cells, but most will not make it near the egg. \n\nThe vagina has many defense mechanisms the sperm must make it through first. Millions of sperm leak from the vagina, some are destroyed by vaginal acid later, or by resident phagocytes in the uterus. \n\n\\underline{\\textbf{B.) Most will be destroyed by the alkaline environment of the vagina at ejaculation.}}\nThis option is incorrect because the vagina has an acidic environment, not an alkaline environment. Even then, buffers in the semen can buy some more time for sperm and the acidity of the vagina does not destroy them immediately. \n\n\\underline{\\textbf{C.) Most will be destroyed by capacitation before reaching the oocyte.}}\nCapacitation is the process sperm cells go through that allows them to penetrate and fertilize the egg. It doesn't result in their destruction. \n\n\\underline{\\textbf{D.) Only one will release its acrosomal enzymes to penetrate the outer layers of the oocyte.}}\nAny sperm cell that makes it to the oocyte and undergoes capacitation can release acrosomal enzymes. That being said, only one sperm cell ends us actually fertilizing the egg. ",
