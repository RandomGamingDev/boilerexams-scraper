    "solution": "In the video, it is stated that sulfur is more electronegative than oxygen which makes the thiol the acid. This is incorrect; the thiol molecule IS still the acid in this reaction, but it isn't due to electronegativity. Although oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur, sulfur is a much larger atom than oxygen (it's in the period beneath oxygen), so its larger radius makes it easier to give away a hydrogen atom/proton, making it the acid.",
